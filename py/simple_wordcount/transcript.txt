welcome back to the next live show I'm
00:08
here with Dave ransom Google sre
00:11
director thanks for joining us that flew
00:13
Trevor Murdoch
00:13
now you've written a few books on the
00:15
cloud now the old latest is an O'Reilly
00:18
publication of the site reliability
00:20
workbook yep beautiful time it's a
00:24
collaborative effort this time right who
00:26
is it mental anyone doing Production
00:28
Engineering in the modern age we all
00:32
want our little things to grow to be
00:33
very large and what happens when they do
00:36
and how do we make that happen to work
00:37
this book is the work of 150 plus
00:40
Googlers plus 25 or 30 people from
00:44
outside of Google big you know New York
00:46
Times and Netflix and all sorts
00:48
wonderful companies Wendy plastic yeah
00:50
now as you said it wasn't just Google
00:53
Lucy you know you mentioned a few
00:54
companies what made you bring all of
00:56
these people all these new authors from
00:58
other places on board well you know the
01:00
big thing is two years ago when we
01:01
publish the first seseri book they
01:03
weren't on investor visa outside of
01:04
Google there was some but not a ton it's
01:07
spreading very far and wide now and
01:09
there are a lot of other companies have
01:11
a lot a really useful stuff to teach the
01:14
world about how to sre if you will and
01:16
we thought like no implementation book
01:18
is going to be complete if we don't
01:19
include those voices and we're really
01:21
glad we we did that some of this content
01:23
is is really pretty special that's
01:25
fantastic now you know you mentioned
01:27
sort of Google and these other big
01:28
companies now I would think that being
01:30
an SRE in a that in a place like Google
01:32
where you've got thousands of sre
01:35
specialists is gonna be pretty different
01:36
from a company of like you know 30
01:38
people total well you know this is a
01:41
common kind of a question I think the
01:43
important thing is to separate the
01:45
principles of SRA on the from the
01:47
practice eviscerated the principles of
01:50
sre here our budgets Nestle is an SLS
01:51
they apply at any scale to people three
01:54
who will 30 people 3,000 people that's
01:56
not a problem the practices are going to
01:58
change and evolve as you grow larger as
02:00
you would expect to have happen they
02:02
have here you know we started s3 15 ish
02:04
years ago here at Google we weren't
02:06
2,500 sres we were like three
02:09
absolutely now it's a it's a it's a
02:12
pretty it's a pretty hefty tone you've
02:14
got here is arrested for a lot of people
02:16
involved if a CTO ask you what's the one
02:20
chapter I should read how can I get the
02:22
most out of this what's what's the
02:24
chapter you'd suggest in any way well
02:26
everyone in the editorial team has their
02:28
favorite my personal favorite is a
02:30
chapter called now ste non-abstract
02:32
large systems design it really walks
02:34
through how as sres we want you and
02:37
expect you to think about how to
02:39
construct a large distributed system
02:41
it's it's it's an incredibly useful
02:44
skill that anyone can learn and a kind
02:47
of technique that not a lot of people
02:49
sort of intuitively apply and we expect
02:51
every s3 to be able to do it and so that
02:54
was very hard but a lot of fun and very
02:56
fulfilling the right fantastic it sounds
02:58
like a really good way to sort of find
03:00
out something you no matter what your
03:02
experience is gonna be a new experience
03:04
for a lot of folks fantastic now this is
03:08
book two you've got you know your only
03:09
way to a true trilogy if not more what
03:12
what do you have in store first welcome
03:13
to look for doing wow we just launched
03:17
this one and it was a lot of work with a
03:19
lot of people I will there be a third
03:22
book I imagine they're probably well
03:23
actually I hope they'll be a lot of them
03:25
and I hope they'll come from a lot of
03:26
different places
03:27
what will it be me know I don't know
03:28
it's once when the memory of this effort
03:31
has worn off just a little all right
03:33
will hold you to that we're gonna check
03:34
it back in now last question I want to
03:37
know is how do you think that the move
03:39
to cloud has really shaped this book
03:41
well I mean the fact of the matter is is
03:45
before Google did cloud we ran our
03:48
infrastructure for ourselves and so in a
03:51
way we could kind of have shortcuts
03:52
because we could prescribe to our
03:53
developers do it this way do it that way
03:55
do some other way when you're giving
03:57
your infrastructure to other people
03:58
you've got a lot less control over how
04:00
they use it right absolutely and also
04:02
the reliability the experience becomes a
04:05
partnership it's a combination of the
04:06
decisions they make and the decisions we
04:09
make running the infrastructure and that
04:11
was really the impetus for both books is
04:13
we can't expect them to have a good
04:15
experience you know if we haven't
04:17
tried to help them think through how
04:18
they're gonna do it it makes a lot of
04:20
sense so obviously the question everyone
04:22
wants to know is how can they get a copy
04:24
of this book well okay if you're here at
04:26
