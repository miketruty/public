# go.practice

## Go practice code.

*   This repo includes practice coding questions/answers written in Go
    (golang) code.
*   Start in the `_template` directory to get a general file format pattern.
*   Use `~/bin/rungotests.sh` to discover and run unit tests (exercise your
    code) from within an individual problem practice directory.
*   Note that the `hello` and `simpletest` directories simply illustrate very simple patterns.
    Prefer to use the pattern of _template.

## Go style

For go style conventions, start with
[Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html).

For example code, don't forget [gobyexample.com](https://gobyexample.com).

Run:

```
goimports -w
```
